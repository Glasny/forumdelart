<h1>Forum de l'art</h1>

Web Project - CNAM - July 2015

Server side: PHP, MySQL, Nginx server<br/>
Client side: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Description :** This project took me roughly 7 weeks to complete.<br/>
The idea was to build an open platform for amateur artists, allowing them to share their work with other art enthousiasts.<br/>
I came up with the original idea, and built the website from scratch.
